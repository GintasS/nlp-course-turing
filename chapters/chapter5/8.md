B) Hugging Face Hub
C) Remote URLs
D) All of the above

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>D</details>

### 2. Suppose you load one of the GLUE tasks as follows:

```py

dataset = load_dataset("glue", "mrpc", split="train")
```

Which of the following commands will produce a random sample of 50 elements from `dataset`?

A) `dataset.sample(50)`
B) `dataset.shuffle().select(range(50))`
