# Ungraded quiz

So far, this chapter has covered a lot of ground! Don't worry if you didn't grasp all the details, but it's to reflect on what you've learned so far with a quiz.

This quiz is ungraded, so you can try it as many times as you want. If you struggle with some questions, follow the tips and revisit the material. You'll be quizzed on this material again in the certification exam.

### 2. What will the following code return?

```py
from transformers import pipeline

ner = pipeline("ner", grouped_entities=True)
ner("My name is Sylvain and I work at Hugging Face in Brooklyn.")
```




### 3. What should replace ... in this code sample?

```py
from transformers import pipeline

filler = pipeline("fill-mask", model="bert-base-cased")
result = filler("...")
```

A. 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'
B. 'The quick brown [MASK] jumps over the lazy dog.'
C. 'The quick brown fox jumps over the [MASK] dog.'
D. 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy [MASK].'

### 4. Why will this code fail?

from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
result = classifier("This is a course about the Transformers library")
